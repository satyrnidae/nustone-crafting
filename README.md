# NuStone Crafting

A simple data pack which adds the newer stone variants (granite, andesite, diorite, tuff, calcite, and basalt) to the stone tool materials and stone crafting materials tags.

## Altered crafting recipes

This data pack also overrides the following default Minecraft recipes, and allows them to be crafted with the stone types in the Stone Crafting Materials tags:

- Dispenser
- Dropper
- Lever
- Observer
- Piston

## Mod loader support

This pack is also available as a standalone data pack/mod to allow it to automatically load its recipes at startup.
